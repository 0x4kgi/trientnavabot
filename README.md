# Trientnava Discord Bot

Personal discord bot. Mostly has [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/) related commands, for now.

Will probably not have any highly computational tasks since I will be hosting this on my really old and cheap chromebook I got for free.


Developed on Python 3.12.10


# Libraries used
- pycord (2.6.1)
- ossapi (5.2.1)
